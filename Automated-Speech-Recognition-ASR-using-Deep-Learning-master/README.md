# Automated-Speech-Recognition-ASR-using-Deep-Learning
Welcome to the introduction of our latest Github project!

This project focuses on the development of a state-of-the-art automated speech recognition (ASR) system using deep learning methods. The goal of this project is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of ASR technology by leveraging the latest advancements in artificial intelligence.

Our project incorporates a range of deep learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and transformers. By integrating these methods, we have created a highly advanced ASR system capable of accurately transcribing speech in real-time.

One of the unique aspects of our project is the comprehensive analysis of the impact of various design choices on the performance of the ASR system. For example, we examined the effect of the number of layers and the number of filters per layer on the accuracy of the model. We also tested a bagging scheme as a regularization technique to enhance the stability and accuracy of the system.

To optimize our ASR system even further, we conducted an extensive hyperparameter search using Bayesian optimization. This allowed us to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and achieve even greater accuracy and efficiency.

Overall, this project showcases the potential of deep learning methods for ASR applications. By leveraging these cutting-edge technologies, we can create more accurate and efficient ASR systems capable of transcribing speech in real-time. We hope that our project inspires others to explore the possibilities of AI-powered speech recognition technology and develop their own innovative solutions.
